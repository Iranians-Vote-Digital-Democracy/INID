### Overall Analysis

This code is implementing a function to get the ID PIN status from a smart card. It:

1. Selects the appropriate application on the card
2. Navigates through the file system to locate PIN information
3. Sends commands to retrieve PIN status data for both ID PIN and other security elements
4. Processes the results to determine the overall PIN status (enabled/disabled, tries remaining)
5. Returns the PIN status information through output parameters

The APDU commands are typical for interacting with a smart card's file system and security features. The code performs complex status processing to interpret the results from these commands and determine the current state of the PIN on the card.

### 1. Select Application APDU
```
"00a4040c10a0000000183003010000000000000000"
```
- Command: SELECT
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: A4 (SELECT)
- P1: 04 (Select by AID)
- P2: 0C (No response data)
- Lc: 10 (16 bytes of data follow)
- Data: A0000000183003010000000000000000 (Application ID)

This selects an application on the card with the specified AID.

### 2. Navigate File System APDUs
```
"00a4000c023f00"
```
- Command: SELECT
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: A4 (SELECT)
- P1: 00 (Select by file ID)
- P2: 0C (No response data)
- Lc: 02 (2 bytes of data follow)
- Data: 3F00 (MF - Master File)

This selects the Master File (root directory) in the card file system.

```
"00a4010c020200"
```
- Command: SELECT
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: A4 (SELECT)
- P1: 01 (Select by child DF)
- P2: 0C (No response data)
- Lc: 02 (2 bytes of data follow)
- Data: 0200 (Directory File ID)

This selects a specific directory file (DF) under the current directory.

```
"00a4020c022f01"
```
- Command: SELECT
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: A4 (SELECT)
- P1: 02 (Select by Elementary File ID)
- P2: 0C (No response data)
- Lc: 02 (2 bytes of data follow)
- Data: 2F01 (Elementary File ID)

This selects an Elementary File (EF) under the current directory.

### 3. PIN Status Check APDU
```
"80c002050c"
```
- Command: PROPRIETARY
- CLA: 80 (Proprietary)
- INS: C0 (Proprietary instruction - likely GET DATA)
- P1: 02 (Parameter 1)
- P2: 05 (Parameter 2)
- Lc: 0C (12 bytes expected in response)

This is a proprietary command to retrieve data about PIN status. This command is sent after navigating to specific files and appears to be retrieving information about PINs (Personal Identification Numbers) on the card.

### 4. ID PIN Status Flow
The code then navigates to different files to check the status of various PINs:
1. First checks PIN data in one location (referred to as "%pins")
2. Then checks PIN data in another location (referred to as "%evpins")
3. Processes the result to determine the ID PIN status

### 5. Authentication APDU
```
"00a4040c0ca0000000180c000001634200"
```
- Command: SELECT
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: A4 (SELECT)
- P1: 04 (Select by AID)
- P2: 0C (No response data)
- Lc: 0C (12 bytes of data follow)
- Data: A0000000180C000001634200 (Application ID)

This selects another application on the card, likely for authentication purposes.

```
"0020008100"
```
- Command: VERIFY
- CLA: 00 (Standard)
- INS: 20 (VERIFY)
- P1: 00 (Parameter 1)
- P2: 81 (Parameter 2, typically PIN reference)
- Lc: 00 (No data - this means it's checking PIN status)

This is a PIN verification command, but with no PIN data (Lc=00), which means it's checking the PIN status rather than actually verifying a PIN.
